#### 3D Reconstruction
3D reconstruction is a central problem in computer vision, focused on inferring three-dimensional structures from a collection of two-dimensional images. One popular approach to this problem is to simultaneously infer the camera *motion* (position and orientation) and scene *structure* (as a point cloud), a class of methods known as *Structure from Motion* â€“ or *SfM* for short.

The aim of my third-year dissertation project at the University of Cambridge was therefore to design, implement and evaluate a complete SfM pipeline. I focused on two pipeline stages in particular: triangulation, and bundle adjustment.
